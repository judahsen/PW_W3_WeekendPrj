How To Use the Rental Property Calculator
Using the BiggerPockets Rental Property Calculator is a straightforward process that allows you to analyze any rental property deal with precision. To make the most of this tool, you'll need specific information about the property and your financial situation.

Here's what you need and how to use the calculator effectively:

Property Information: Enter the property's address, purchase price, and estimated closing costs. You can find this information on listing sites, through your investor-friendly real estate agent, or directly from the seller.
Loan Details: Specify your down payment percentage, interest rate, loan term (e.g., 30 years), and whether you're paying points on the loan. These details determine your financing terms. An investor-friendly lender can help you get the best funding for your strategy.
Income: Enter the estimated monthly rental income. You can gather this information from rental listing sites, local market knowledge, or BiggerPockets Insights (if you have access).
Expenses: Include all relevant expenses, such as property taxes, insurance, utilities (if you're responsible), repairs and maintenance, capital expenditures, property management fees (if applicable), HOA fees (if applicable), garbage, sewer, and vacancy rate.
Analysis: Once you've input all the necessary data, the calculator generates a comprehensive report. You'll find details about your annualized return, cash flow, cash-on-cash return, cap rate, and more. These metrics help you assess the profitability of the deal.
Fine-Tuning: Feel free to adjust your assumptions and see how they impact the results. For instance, you can experiment with different rent values, vacancy rates, or financing options to evaluate various scenarios.
